# Cylinder/MooreCylinder — the geometric Moore cylinder and its composition

A **Moore cylinder** of length `n` over `K` is a directed homotopy whose interval is the
serial interval `Iₙ = □¹ ∨ ⋯ ∨ □¹`: a map `src ⟶ (PathObPow n).obj K` into the length-`n`
iterated path object (`Foundations/PathIterate.lean`).  For `n = 1` this is exactly an
ordinary cylinder `CylMap K = Over (PathOb K)` (`Cylinder/Cylinder.lean`), since
`PathObPow 1 = PathOb`.

The point of this file is the **geometric composition** answering the question: a "list of
cylinders" is the trivial monoidal lift; what we actually want is a single geometric cylinder
realising the concatenation.  Given Moore cylinders `c : E₁ ⟶ PathObPowⁿ K` and
`d : E₂ ⟶ PathObPowᵐ K` whose matched outer legs agree (`c`'s right end glued to `d`'s left
end), `mooreCompose` produces a *single* Moore cylinder of length `n + m`:

* its source is the span-pullback `E₃ = E₁ ×_K E₂` (gluing `c.endLeg` to `d.startLeg`);
* its classifying map is the glued pair `⟨π₁ ≫ c.cyl, π₂ ≫ d.cyl⟩ : E₃ ⟶ PathObPowⁿ K ×_K
  PathObPowᵐ K`, transported across the length-additivity iso
  `PathObPow^{n+m} K ≅ PathObPowⁿ K ×_K PathObPowᵐ K` (`pathObPowGlueIso`).

So `mooreCompose` is the genuine *single-cylinder realisation* of the list `[c, d]`.  Its
outer legs are the outer legs of the factors (`mooreCompose_startLeg`/`_endLeg`), and its
length is additive (`mooreCompose_len`).

## Length-`0` = constant cylinder = composition unit + the `End(K)` embedding

Since `PathObPow 0 = 𝟭`, a **length-`0`** Moore cylinder is just a bare map `cyl : E ⟶ K`: a
*degenerate/constant* directed homotopy (start leg = end leg = `cyl`).  Two payoffs:

* `mooreId K = ⟨0, K, 𝟙 K⟩` is the **composition unit** — `mooreComposeIdRight` proves the right
  unit law `mooreCompose c (mooreId K) ≅ c` (as a same-shape `MIso`); the left unit law holds the
  same way but is left as a TODO-comment (it carries a genuine `0 + c.n = c.n` length cast).
* `MooreCyl.ofEnd (φ : K ⟶ K) = ⟨0, K, φ⟩` (and `ofMap` for general `Hom(E,K)`) realises the
  embedding `End(K) ↪ MooreCyl K` (`ofEnd_injective`, `ofEnd_id`) with **no degeneracy**
  `K ⟶ PathOb K` — the construction the cylinder program's "STEP 4" wanted.

The descent theorem (`mooreCompose_one_one_cyl`) records that, in length `1 + 1`, the composite
underlies the length-`2` span composition into `PathObPow 2 = PathOb K ×_K PathOb K` (the
length-`2` cocylinder), i.e. it *is* the span-pullback gluing of the two strict cylinders —
not a fold-collapsed length-`1` cylinder (no such fold exists; see
`Research/Scratch/Cyl7_SpanCompose`).

**Layer:** Cylinder.  **Imports:** `Foundations/PathIterate` (`PathObPow`, `pathObPowGlueIso`),
`Cylinder/Cylinder` (`CylMap`).

## Remaining step (not a `sorry`)

Relating `mooreCompose` to the pointed-endofunctor descent `cylToPointedObj`
(`Cylinder/CylinderRefine.lean`) — i.e. that Moore composition is a monoid homomorphism into
the directed-path groupoid — is deferred: it needs the Moore analogue of the prism/refinement
geometry and is orthogonal to the additivity established here.

/-! ## Length-`0` Moore cylinders: the composition unit and the `End(K)` embedding

`PathObPow 0 = 𝟭` (`Foundations/PathIterate.lean`), so a **length-`0`** Moore cylinder is just a
plain map `cyl : E ⟶ K` (no interval to sweep): a *constant/degenerate* directed homotopy whose
start and end legs both equal `cyl`.  Two facts make these the algebraic skeleton of the
composition monoid:

* `mooreId K = ⟨0, K, 𝟙 K⟩` is the **unit**: composing on the right (`mooreComposeIdRight`) gives
  a same-shape isomorphism `mooreCompose c (mooreId K) ≅ c` (`MIso`).  The composite source is the
  pullback `c.src ×_K K` along `(mooreId K).startLeg = 𝟙 K`, whose first projection is an iso
  (`pullback_fst_iso_of_right_iso`); the length cast `c.n + 0 = c.n` is definitional, so no
  `eqToHom` bookkeeping is needed.  (The **left** unit `mooreCompose (mooreId K) c ≅ c` is the
  mirror image but its length is `0 + c.n`, which is only *propositionally* `c.n` — `Nat.zero_add`
  is not defeq — forcing a genuine length cast through `PathObPow`; that cast reduces to
  characterising `(glueAt 0 m K).snd` as the cast `eqToHom`, an induction on `m` left as a TODO,
  see below.)

* `MooreCyl.ofEnd (φ : K ⟶ K) = ⟨0, K, φ⟩` realises **`End(K) ↪ MooreCyl K`** (more generally
  `ofMap (f : E ⟶ K) = ⟨0, E, f⟩` for `Hom(E,K)`).  It is injective in `φ` (`ofEnd_injective`)
  and sends `𝟙 K` to the unit (`ofEnd_id`).  Crucially this needs **no degeneracy** `K ⟶ PathOb K`
  (a length-`0` homotopy has no interval), which is precisely the embedding the cylinder program's
  "STEP 4" wanted but could not get through `PathOb` for want of a degeneracy. -/

/-- The **length-`0` (degenerate/constant) Moore cylinder on `E` with classifying map `f`**:
`⟨0, E, f⟩`.  Since `PathObPow 0 = 𝟭`, this is just the bare map `f : E ⟶ K` viewed as a constant

The mirror statement `mooreCompose (mooreId K) c ≅ c` holds geometrically by the same pullback
argument: `composeSrc (mooreId K) c = K ×_K c.src` is a pullback along the iso
`(mooreId K).endLeg = 𝟙 K`, so its **second** projection `composeπ₂ (mooreId K) c` is an iso
(`composeπ₂_mooreId_isIso`).  The obstruction is purely the length: the composite has length
`0 + c.n`, which is only *propositionally* equal to `c.n` (`Nat.zero_add` is not definitional), so
the `MIso.cyl_compat` carries a genuine non-trivial length cast `eqToHom : (PathObPow (0+c.n)).obj K
= (PathObPow c.n).obj K`.  Discharging it reduces to characterising the additivity-iso inverse as
that cast,
  `(pathObPowGlueIso 0 c.n K).inv ≫ eqToHom = pathObPowGlue.snd 0 c.n K`,
equivalently `(glueAt 0 m K).snd = eqToHom (Nat.zero_add ▸ rfl)`, an induction on `m` whose step
unfolds `glueAt`'s `rseg.isPb.lift`.  This cast bookkeeping is deferred (the right unit suffices
for the unit-law content). -/

/-- **The left-unit composite source projection is an iso.**  `composeSrc (mooreId K) c =
K ×_K c.src` is a pullback along the iso `(mooreId K).endLeg = 𝟙 K`, so its second projection is

see the TODO above.) -/
