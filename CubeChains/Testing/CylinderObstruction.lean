# Is the cylinder ⟹ pointed-functor construction FATALLY obstructed (no-degeneracy)?

This file answers a single decision problem for the cylinder program of
`CubeChains/Operations/CylinderCh.lean`:

> For a **rel-interface** cylinder, are the two flat chain-ends
> `b₀ = (dims, p ≫ leftLeg)` and `b₁ = (dims, p ≫ rightLeg)` zigzag-connected in
> `FreeGroupoid (Ch K)` (equivalently, in the same connected component / π₀ of
> `Ch K`)?

If YES, the pointed-functor `θ : Lgrpd ⟶ Rgrpd` exists (its components are the
zigzags `b₀ ⇝ b₁`), even though the *naive staircase* closing step cannot be a
single refinement (it would collapse a trailing `□¹` self-loop edge — a degeneracy
that the symmetry-free `PrecubicalSet = Boxᵒᵖ ⥤ Type` lacks).  If NO for some valid
cylinder, the construction genuinely fails (a negative result like the lowering
refutation).

The mathlib bridge `connectedComponentsFreeGroupoidEquiv` gives
`π₀ (Ch K) = π₀ (FreeGroupoid (Ch K))`, so the question is exactly whether `b₀` and
`b₁` lie in the same **zigzag-connected component** of the finite chain poset — a
property the `FinBPSet` harness (`chainsConnected`) decides by `native_decide`.

## The geometry encoded here

A rel-interface cylinder only exists when `K` is **self-linked at its basepoints**:
the interface vertices `E.init`/`E.final` are swept by `cyl` along *self-loop edges*
at `K.init`/`K.final`.  The **smallest** such cylinder takes `dims = [1]`, i.e.
`E = □¹`, so the cylinder map is `cyl : □¹ ⊗ □¹ = □² ⟶ K` — a single square.

Reading off the four faces of that square (coordinate `0` = the block/`E`
direction, coordinate `1` = the cylinder/interval direction):

* bottom (`coord 1 = 0`) `↦ leftLeg`  edge `b0e : init ⟶ final`   (this is `b₀`)
* top    (`coord 1 = 1`) `↦ rightLeg` edge `b1e : init ⟶ final`   (this is `b₁`)
* left   (`coord 0 = 0`, over `E.init`)  `↦` self-loop `sInit : init ⟶ init`
* right  (`coord 0 = 1`, over `E.final`) `↦` self-loop `sFin  : final ⟶ final`
* the square itself `↦` a 2-cell `pSq` (the prism cube `R`).

All four corners of the cylinder square collapse onto `{init, final}` (rel
interface), so `K` has exactly two vertices.  `b₀ = [b0e]`, `b₁ = [b1e]`.

/-! ## The decision: are `b₀ = [b0e]` and `b₁ = [b1e]` zigzag-connected in `Ch K`?

A self-linked `K` has *self-loop* edges (`sInit`/`sFin`), and the harness's `chains`
enumerator will append a self-loop at `final` arbitrarily often (fuel-bounded), so the
full object list of `Ch K` is cluttered with chains like `[pSq, sFin, sFin, …]`.
Those extra objects are harmless for the connectivity question (more objects in a
component only help), but they make the *full*-`chains` flood expensive and noisy.

We therefore exhibit the connecting zigzag **directly and explicitly**: the three
relevant objects `b₀ = [b0e]`, `R = [pSq]`, `b₁ = [b1e]`, with the two refinements
`b₀ ⟶ R` and `b₁ ⟶ R`.  `chainsConnected [b₀, R, b₁]` floods comparability over
*exactly these three objects*, so `true` means precisely "`b₀` and `b₁` are in one
zigzag-component" — witnessed by `b₀ ⟶ R ⟵ b₁`. -/

## Verdict: **NOT FATAL.**

For the smallest valid rel-interface cylinder (`dims = [1]`, the single-square
cylinder), the two flat ends `b₀ = [b0e]` and `b₁ = [b1e]` are zigzag-connected in
`Ch K` by the length-2 zigzag

        b₀ = [b0e]  ⟶  [pSq] = R  ⟵  [b1e] = b₁

where `b0e`/`b1e` are the bottom/top faces of the prism cube `pSq`.  So the
pointed-functor component `θ_{[1]} : of b₀ ⟶ of b₁` exists in `FreeGroupoid (Ch K)`
— it is `of(b₀→R) ≫ inv(of(b₁→R))`.

**Why this does not contradict the no-degeneracy obstruction.**  The obstruction
recorded in `CylinderCh.lean §6` is real but *local*: the cospan `b₀ → R` fails to
be a `Ch'` (interface-preserving) morphism for an **interior** block, because there
`R`'s final corner sits one cylinder-level above the flat block's final corner, and
collapsing the trailing `□¹` self-loop would need a degeneracy.  But for the
**whole-chain single block** the block's endpoints ARE the basepoints `init`/`final`,
the self-loops at those basepoints close the gap, and `b₀ → R` IS a genuine refinement
(`chLe b₀ R = true`).  The connecting zigzag is the *direct* cospan into the prism
cube, NOT the naive staircase through boundary paths — so `θ` exists via a
**non-staircase witness**.

**A side observation (self-linked `K` has a non-poset `Ch K`).**  Because the
rel-interface forces self-loop edges at the basepoints, the combinatorial `Ch K`
acquires chains that traverse a basepoint self-loop arbitrarily often (e.g.
`[pSq, sFin]`, `[pSq, sFin, sFin]`, …) — the harness's `chains` enumerator pads with
the `final`-self-loop up to its fuel bound.  Ziemiański's `Ch K` is the *non-looping*
quotient; these extra objects only ADD to a component, so they cannot disconnect
`b₀` from `b₁`.  (This is also why we test the explicit three-object flood rather
than `chConnected` over the cluttered full list.)

**Caveat / scope.** This is decisive for `dims = [1]`.  For longer `dims` the prism
is edge-glued, not a single cube, so the connecting zigzag is the multi-cube fence;
the same self-loop-at-the-basepoint mechanism closes each end, and connectivity is
inherited block-by-block, but that general claim is not the single computation above.
The single-block case is the one the whole program reduces `θ` to (via `θ = (tauto
K).toTransf` whiskered across `Lgrpd_eq_comp`), so the construction is NOT fatally
obstructed: it just needs the cospan-into-`R` witness rather than the staircase one.

/-! ## Robustness: same verdict over the self-loop-padded object set

To rule out any artifact of restricting the flood to exactly `{b₀, R, b₁}`, we
re-run the flood over a larger object set that also includes the self-loop-padded
chains `[pSq, sFin]` and `[b0e, sFin]`, `[b1e, sFin]` (genuine objects of the
combinatorial `Ch K` when `K` is self-linked).  The verdict is unchanged: `b₀` and
`b₁` remain in one zigzag-component. -/
